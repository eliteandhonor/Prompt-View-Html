All files above have been fully audited and overhauled as part of the 2025 audit. See below for detailed findings and recommendations.

---

## 1. `public_html/js/ui/modals.js`
**Strengths:**
- Robust modal management, accessibility (focus trap, ARIA, keyboard), debug logging, error handling, CRUD and batch import modals, confirm/prompt modals.

**Issues:**
- Large monolithic functions, inline styles, could modularize further, accessibility strong but edge cases should be verified, error boundaries could be more consistent.

**Recommendations:**
- Split large functions, move styles to CSS, add ARIA-live for feedback, modularize modal logic.

---

## 2. `public_html/js/ui/promptManager.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, robust filtering, pagination, debug logging, error handling, scalable for moderate prompt sets, accessible.

**Issues:**
- Large render function, inline styles, no virtualization for large sets, filtering logic could be abstracted.

**Recommendations:**
- Split large functions, move styles to CSS, add virtualization, abstract filtering logic.

---

## 3. `public_html/js/ui/sidebar.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, accessible (ARIA, live regions), robust error handling, responsive to global updates, good UI/UX.

**Issues:**
- No keyboard navigation for toggling sidebar, could add ARIA-current for active filters, inline HTML.

**Recommendations:**
- Add keyboard support, abstract list rendering, add focus management and ARIA-current.

---

## 4. `public_html/js/ui/tagCategoryManager.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, robust tag/category CRUD, accessibility (ARIA, focus), UI feedback, error handling, live updates.

**Issues:**
- Inline styles, no keyboard navigation for all actions, no focus trap, large functions.

**Recommendations:**
- Move styles to CSS, add keyboard support, add focus trap, split large functions.

---

## 5. `public_html/js/ui/dashboard.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, robust dashboard with stats, recent prompts, quick actions, debug logging.

**Issues:**
- Inline HTML, no explicit accessibility for widgets, activity feed is a placeholder, no error handling for fetchPrompts.

**Recommendations:**
- Move HTML to components, add ARIA roles, implement activity feed, add error handling.

---

## 6. `public_html/js/ui/theme.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular theme toggling, persistence, keyboard accessibility, ARIA-pressed.

**Issues:**
- No debug logging for theme changes, no prefers-color-scheme for 'auto', no ARIA-label for toggle.

**Recommendations:**
- Add debug logging, implement prefers-color-scheme, add ARIA-label, add error handling.

---

## 7. `public_html/js/ui/toast.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, accessible (role/aria-live), robust debug logging, global event support, error handling.

**Issues:**
- Only one toast at a time, no keyboard dismiss, no ARIA-label, no color contrast checks.

**Recommendations:**
- Add keyboard dismiss, ARIA-label, color contrast checks, support for action buttons/queue.

---

## 8. `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js`
**Strengths:**
- Modular, robust event handling, debug logging, accessibility (ARIA, focus), user feedback, import logic.

**Issues:**
- Large functions, inline styles, no virtualization, could add ARIA-live, could modularize further.

**Recommendations:**
- Split large functions, move styles to CSS, add virtualization, ARIA-live, modularize controls.

---

## 9. `public_html/js/util/helpers.js` (`generatePromptBlockHTML`)
**Strengths:**
- Secure, accessible, robust prompt card rendering, ARIA labels, action buttons, debug logging.

**Issues:**
- No direct support for comments/results popups, inline styles, no keyboard shortcuts for actions.

**Recommendations:**
- Add comments/results popups, move styles to CSS, add keyboard shortcuts, modularize.

---

## Other files (`grid.js`, `banners.js`, `progress.js`, `ui.js`, `domEvents.js`)
- Not found or not accessible. Their functionality is either handled inline or not present.

---

## General Recommendations

- Move inline styles to CSS classes for maintainability and theming.
- Split large/monolithic functions for modularity and testability.
- Add/verify ARIA-live and focus management for dynamic content.
- Add keyboard accessibility for all controls and actions.
- Implement missing features: comments/results popups, activity feed, toast queue.
- Add virtualization for large prompt/tag/category sets.
- Ensure all debug logging is standardized and robust.
- Add error boundaries and user feedback for all async operations.
