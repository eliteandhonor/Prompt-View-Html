- [x] **Keyboard Shortcuts for Community UI Actions (`public_html/js/ui/community.js`)**
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Added accessible keyboard shortcuts for key community UI actions:
      - Alt+Shift+C: Focus the comment textarea for rapid comment entry.
      - Alt+Shift+Enter: Submit the comment form (only if textarea is focused).
      - Alt+Shift+R: Refresh comments and results.
    All shortcuts are logged via debugLog for traceability. Shortcuts are attached only once per session and do not conflict with common browser/system shortcuts.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Improves efficiency for power users and accessibility for keyboard users. Alt+Shift combinations are chosen to avoid conflicts with browser/system/assistive tech shortcuts and to require deliberate two-handed activation, reducing accidental triggers. All actions are non-destructive and do not override browser/system accessibility features.
  - **Accessibility Considerations:**  
    - Shortcuts are non-intrusive, do not interfere with screen readers or navigation, and only operate if relevant elements are present and enabled.
    - Focus/submit actions are context-aware and do not trigger if the form is not available or is disabled.
    - All shortcut usage is logged for auditability and debugging.
  - **Checklist:**
    - [x] Add Alt+Shift+C to focus comment textarea
    - [x] Add Alt+Shift+Enter to submit comment form (when textarea focused)
    - [x] Add Alt+Shift+R to refresh comments/results
    - [x] Ensure no conflicts with browser/system/assistive tech shortcuts
    - [x] Provide debug logging for all shortcut usage
    - [x] Document shortcuts, rationale, and accessibility in code comments and AUDITFIX.MD
- [x] **API Integration: Fetch and Render Results in Community Section (`public_html/js/ui/community.js`)**
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Replaced the results placeholder logic with real API integration. The results section now fetches results from the backend using the existing `fetchResults` API client, renders them accessibly, and handles loading and error states. Debug logging is included for all fetch and render steps. The function signatures were updated to accept a `promptId` parameter for context.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This change delivers the planned atomic improvement by connecting the UI to real backend data, improving user experience and accessibility, and ensuring robust error handling and traceability. It lays the foundation for further results-related features and aligns with UI/UX and a11y best practices.

- [x] **Add Analytics/Event Tracking: public_html/js/ui/modals.js**  
- [x] **Implement Undo for Destructive Modal Actions: public_html/js/ui/modals.js**  
  - **Feature Addition:**  
    Added undo support for prompt deletion. When a prompt is deleted, a toast with "Undo" is shown for 5 seconds. If clicked, the prompt is restored using the cached data.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Prevents accidental data loss and improves user trust.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Provides a safety net for destructive actions, aligning with modern UX best practices.
---
  - **Feature Addition:**  
    Imported `trackEvent` from `util/analytics.js` and added event tracking for:
      - Modal open/close (all modals)
      - Confirm/cancel actions (confirm, prompt, batch import)
      - Destructive actions (prompt delete)
      - Batch import submit/cancel/errors
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Enables auditability and behavioral analytics for modal interactions.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Supports product analytics, debugging, and compliance requirements.
---
  - **Architecture Review:**  
    Confirmed all modal event wiring is centralized in the `wireModalEvents` function, called from `initModals`.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    No code changes required; event wiring is already centralized.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Ensures maintainable, auditable, and consistent modal event handling.
---
  - **API/Module Review:**  
    Confirmed `openBatchImportModal` is exported for direct import and event-based use.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    No code changes required; export already present.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Ensures batch import modal logic is accessible for integration and testing.
---
  - **Code Quality Improvement:**  
    Extracted a `wireCloseButton` helper to handle close button click and keydown events for modals.  
    Replaced repeated close button wiring in `wireCrudModalActions` and related code with this helper.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Centralizes modal close logic, making future changes and audits easier.
---
  - **Accessibility Enhancement:**  
    Added visually hidden `<div aria-live="polite">` live regions to confirm and prompt modals.  
    On modal close, these regions announce "Confirmed", "Cancelled", or "Input submitted" for screen readers.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Ensures all dynamic modal actions are announced to assistive technology users.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Improves accessibility and compliance with ARIA live region best practices.
---
  - **Accessibility Review:**  
    Confirmed that both static and dynamic modals (including confirm and prompt modals) remove all ARIA attributes (`aria-modal`, `role`, `aria-labelledby`) and `aria-live` from children on close.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    No code changes required; code is already compliant.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Ensures accessibility best practices for screen readers and assistive technology.
---
  - **Refactor:**  
    Added a `DEBUG_MODALS` flag and a `debugLogIfEnabled` wrapper. All debug and console log output is now gated behind this flag.  
    To enable modal debug logs, set `window.DEBUG_MODALS = true` in the browser console.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Prevents debug output from leaking into production or user-facing environments.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Ensures clean logs and allows for easy toggling of debug output for troubleshooting.
---
  - **Refactor:**  
    Moved all modal open/close and action event listeners (window.addEventListener, closeModalBtns, etc.) into a new `wireModalEvents` function at the module scope.  
    Called `wireModalEvents` from `initModals` to ensure all modal event wiring is handled in one place.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Improves maintainability, clarity, and reduces risk of duplicate or missed event wiring.
  - **Rationale:**  
    Centralizing event wiring makes modal logic easier to audit, extend, and debug.
---
  - **API Enhancement:**  
    Moved `openBatchImportModal` from inside `initModals` to the module scope and exported it. The function is now available for direct import by other modules, while still supporting event-based invocation for backward compatibility.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Enables batch import modal logic to be reused, tested, and integrated in a more modular way.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This improves code modularity, testability, and extensibility, allowing batch import modal logic to be invoked programmatically as well as via events.
---
  - **Function Decomposition:**  
    The large `renderCrudForm` function was split into three focused helpers: `renderCrudView` (view mode rendering), `renderCrudFormFields` (form mode rendering), and `wireCrudModalActions` (centralized event wiring for modal actions).  
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Removed duplicate/legacy code, eliminated repeated event handler logic, and ensured all modal open/close and action wiring is DRY and maintainable.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This improves code readability, maintainability, and testability, and ensures all modal logic is consistent and easy to extend or debug.
---
  - **Accessibility Enhancement:**  
    Added a visually hidden live region (`aria-live="polite"`) to the CRUD modal. All major dynamic content changes (view, create, update, delete, error) now trigger an announcement for screen readers.
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Updated `renderCrudForm` to inject and update a live region, ensuring users of assistive technology are notified of modal state changes and actions.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This ensures that all users, including those using screen readers, receive immediate feedback about modal content changes, aligning with WCAG accessibility best practices.
---
  - **Accessibility Compliance:**  
    All ARIA attributes set on modal open (aria-modal, role, aria-labelledby, aria-live) are now explicitly removed or reset when a modal is closed, both for static and dynamically created modals.  
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Updated `closeModal` and dynamic modal cleanup logic to remove these attributes and clean up any live regions, ensuring no stale ARIA state remains in the DOM after modal closure.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This prevents accessibility issues for screen readers and other assistive technologies, ensuring that modals do not leave behind misleading ARIA attributes or live regions after being closed. Aligns with a11y best practices and improves overall UI robustness.
---
  - **Centralized Debug Logging:**  
    All debug output in `modals.js` is now routed through the `debugLog` utility, which is gated by both the `window.DEBUG_MODE` runtime flag and the `DEBUG` config flag.  
  - **Atomic Change:**  
    Replaced all direct `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` calls with `debugLog`. Removed legacy `[DEBUG]` comments and ensured no debug output is emitted unless debugging is enabled.
  - **Rationale:**  
    This enables consistent, environment-controlled debug output for all modal logic, supporting both runtime toggling and build-time configuration. It prevents debug noise in production and aligns with project-wide best practices for traceable, filterable logs.
---
- [x] **Atomic Audit & Debug Overhaul: public_html/js/util/helpers.js**

    Added debugLog to every function, including utility, rendering, and error functions. All major state transitions, parameter validation, and error branches are now logged.
  - **Bug Fixes:**  
    Fixed a critical bug in `renderMarkdownToHTML` where HTML escaping was ineffective, preventing XSS. Fixed a syntax error in `escapeHtml` for the single quote case.
  - **Deduplication & Cleanup:**  
    Removed duplicate JSDoc comments and redundant function definitions caused by previous partial edits. Ensured each function is defined only once, with a single, correct docblock.
  - **Maintainability & Modularity:**  
    Clarified parameter validation, improved error handling in `showError`, and ensured all utility functions are robust against invalid input.
  - **UI/UX & Accessibility:**  
    Verified that all generated HTML (forms, blocks) includes appropriate ARIA attributes, keyboard accessibility, and live regions for feedback.
  - **Documentation:**  
    Added or clarified JSDoc comments for all functions, ensuring maintainability and clarity for future contributors.

# AUDITFIX.MD
- [x] **Accessibility & UI/UX: Tag Buttons**  
- [x] **Defensive Coding: Categories & Tags**  
- [x] **Security: innerHTML Usage**  
  Reviewed all uses of `innerHTML` in promptManager.js. All user data is sanitized via `escapeHtml` or `renderMarkdownToHTML`, which properly escape HTML special characters and prevent XSS. No unsafe assignments found. Documented this for audit traceability.
  Added robust null/undefined checks for all uses of categories and tags. All filter, find, and map operations on categories/tags are now guarded with `Array.isArray` checks, preventing runtime errors if app state is not yet initialized or data is missing. This ensures stable rendering and filtering regardless of backend or state issues.
  Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation for tag filter buttons. Added `role="button"`, `aria-pressed="false"`, and `tabindex="0"` to all tag buttons. Implemented keyboard event handling (Enter/Space) for full keyboard accessibility. Enhanced focus and active styles for better visibility, and ensured color changes are accessible for colorblind users. All interactive tag elements now have clear aria-labels and are fully accessible.

## Atomic Audit & Debug Overhaul: public_html/js/ui/modals.js

- [x] **Debug Logging Coverage**  
  Added or improved debug logs at entry/exit of every function, event handler, and async operation for full traceability.

- [x] **Focus Trap Cleanup**  
  Ensured only one keydown handler is attached per modal for focus trap, and always cleaned up on close to prevent memory leaks.

- [x] **Modal DOM Management**  
  Refactored modal open/close logic to avoid removing static modals from the DOM; only dynamically created modals (confirm/prompt) are removed. Static modals are hidden/inerted for accessibility.

- [x] **Accessibility: Focus Management**  
  Standardized fallback focus to `#main-content` if present, else `body`, for all modal close operations.

- [x] **MutationObserver in renderCrudForm**  
  Disconnected MutationObserver after use to prevent memory leaks.

- [x] **Event Handler Attachments**  
  Made close button event handler attachment idempotent to prevent duplicate handlers if `initModals` is called multiple times.

All issues above were addressed in a single atomic update to `public_html/js/ui/modals.js`.
## Atomic Audit & Debug Overhaul: public_html/js/ui/promptManager.js

- [x] **Debug Logging Coverage**  
  Added debugLog calls at the entry and successful exit of every function and event handler, including async operations and UI event listeners. This provides full traceability for debugging, making it easier to follow control flow and diagnose issues. All major state transitions, successful completions, and error branches are now logged in a standardized way.

- [x] **Debug Logging Consistency**  
- [x] **Code Modularity: Control Listeners**  
- [x] **Event Handler Idempotency**  
- [x] **Accessibility & UI/UX: Delete Confirmation Modal**  
  Replaced the use of `confirm()` for prompt deletion in `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js` with a custom modal dialog. The new modal includes proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation (Tab/Escape), and a focus trap for accessibility. This ensures destructive actions are consistent with the app's modal UX and accessible to all users.
  Updated event handler attachment logic in `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js` to be idempotent. The MutationObserver now tracks listener state and only attaches listeners when the section becomes visible and not already attached, preventing duplicate handlers and potential memory leaks.
  Refactored the large `attachPromptListControlListeners` function in `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js` into smaller, focused helpers: `attachViewToggleListeners`, `attachAddPromptListener`, `attachBatchImportListener`, and `attachImportPromptsListener`. Each helper now encapsulates its own event logic, improving maintainability, readability, and testability.
  Replaced all uses of `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` with `debugLog` for consistent debug logging throughout `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js`. This ensures all debug output is controlled by the `DEBUG_MODE` flag and is standardized for easier tracing and filtering.
---
## Atomic Audit & Debug Overhaul: public_html/js/ui/sidebar.js

- [x] **Centralized Debug Logging**

- [x] **Code Modularity: List Rendering & Event Binding**
  Refactored repeated logic for rendering categories/tags and attaching event handlers into a single helper (`renderListWithHandlers`). This reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent accessibility and event logic for both lists.

- [x] **Event Handler Idempotency & Cleanup**
  All event handler attachments (sidebar toggle, "My Prompts", categories, tags) are now idempotent. Previous listeners are removed by cloning/replacing DOM nodes before re-attaching, preventing duplicate handlers and memory leaks, especially after repeated updates.

- [x] **Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation**
  Improved keyboard accessibility for all interactive sidebar elements. All list items now support Enter/Space activation, and the sidebar toggle and "My Prompts" button are fully keyboard accessible. Focus is programmatically set to the first interactive element when the sidebar opens, enhancing screen reader and keyboard navigation.

- [x] **Debounce for Sidebar Toggle**
  Added a debounce utility to prevent rapid sidebar toggling, improving UI responsiveness and preventing accidental double-activations.

- [x] **Robust Error Handling & User Feedback**
  All async operations (category/tag loading) now log errors via `debugLog` and provide clear user feedback in the UI. Empty/error states are rendered with accessible ARIA attributes and hints.

- [x] **UI/UX Consistency & Maintainability**
  All improvements ensure the sidebar logic is modular, maintainable, and consistent with the rest of the app. All interactive elements have clear ARIA labels, roles, and live regions for accessibility.

    Added a visual loading indicator and ARIA live announcement when filtering or searching prompts, not just when fetching from the server. This improves perceived performance and accessibility for users, especially those using assistive technology.
  - **User Feedback for Empty Results (A11y):**  
    Ensured that when no prompts are found, the ARIA live region announces "No prompts found." This provides immediate, accessible feedback for screen reader users.
  - **Live Region Announcements for Dynamic Updates:**  
    Added a visually hidden `<div aria-live="polite">` live region to the prompt list container. All dynamic updates (filtering, search, empty state, result count) are now announced for accessibility compliance and improved UX.
  - **Refactor: Split Large Functions & DRY Logic:**  
    Refactored the large `renderPrompts` function into smaller helpers: `filterPrompts`, `renderPromptList`, and event binding logic. This improves maintainability, readability, and testability, and ensures DRY principles are followed.
  - **Analytics/Event Tracking:**  
    Imported and used `trackEvent` from `util/analytics.js` to track filter, search, tag click, and result events. This enables future insights into user behavior and supports audit/compliance requirements.
  - **Undo for Destructive Actions (Stub):**  
    Added a documented stub for undo logic for future destructive actions (e.g., prompt deletion). This aligns with best practices and ensures the code is ready for future UX improvements.
  - **Rationale:**  
    These changes address all atomic audit requirements for promptManager.js, ensuring best practices for code quality, accessibility, UI/UX, and analytics. All changes are modular, maintainable, and fully documented for future audits.

  - **Refactored `public_html/js/ui/promptList.js`:**
    - Replaced legacy string-based prompt rendering (`generatePromptBlockHTML`) with the modular, accessible `renderPromptBlock` from `renderPromptBlock.js`.
    - For each prompt, appended a dedicated comments/results container and invoked `renderCommentsResults` to allow direct interaction (add/view) from the prompt display.
    - Removed all legacy event delegation and modal logic for prompt block actions, as these are now handled modularly and accessibly.
    - Updated imports to remove `generatePromptBlockHTML` and add `renderPromptBlock` and `renderCommentsResults`.
    - Cleaned up redundant debug logs and ensured all new code follows accessibility and maintainability best practices.
  - **Removed Redundant/Legacy Code:**
    - Deleted the `generatePromptBlockHTML` function from `public_html/js/util/helpers.js` and all usages, eliminating duplication and reducing maintenance burden.
    - Ensured all prompt display logic is now centralized in `renderPromptBlock.js` for clarity and future extensibility.
  - **Accessibility, Modularity, and Maintainability:**
    - All prompt blocks and comments/results containers use appropriate ARIA roles, labels, and keyboard navigation.
    - UI is now fully modular, with each prompt and its associated actions/comments/results encapsulated in a single, reusable DOM structure.
    - Code is organized for maintainability, with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.
  - **Rationale:**
    - This overhaul resolves previous issues with duplicated rendering logic, inconsistent event handling, and lack of direct comments/results interaction.
    - The new approach guarantees best UI/UX practices, accessibility, and a maintainable codebase for future enhancements.

    - [x] Documented audit and rationale in AUDITFIX.MD
- [x] **Atomic Fix: Correct all references to `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js` → `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js` in all loader/entrypoint scripts.**
  - **Rationale:** Ensures that all UI features relying on modals and toasts are properly loaded after directory restructuring. Prevents 404 errors and broken UI components.
  - **Result:** Searched all relevant files (`public_html/index.html`, `public_html/js/main.js`, `public_html/js/ui.js`, `public_html/js/ui/eventHandlers.js`, and all loader/entrypoint scripts). All references in the current codebase already use the correct `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js` paths. No changes were required. Legacy code references remain unchanged as they do not affect the current app.
- [x] **Atomic Fix: Audit and Correct `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js` References (2025-05-06)**
  - **Atomic Change:** Searched the entire codebase (including legacy, build scripts, and configuration files) for any dynamic script loading, `import()`, `require()`, or string-based references to `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js`. No incorrect or legacy references were found in any active code; all current references correctly use `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js`.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures all UI features relying on modals and toasts are properly loaded after directory restructuring. Prevents 404 errors and broken UI components. No changes required; codebase is already correct and all features are functional.
  - **Checklist:**
    - [x] Deep search for `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js` (including dynamic, string, and legacy references)
    - [x] Confirmed all active references use `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js`
    - [x] No changes required; codebase is already correct
    - [x] Documented audit and rationale in AUDITFIX.MD
- [x] **Audit: Ensure all dynamic imports, require calls, and script injections for modals and toasts use correct UI paths**
  - Searched all entrypoint and loader scripts (including `public_html/js/main.js`, `public_html/js/ui.js`, `public_html/js/ui/eventHandlers.js`, and all scripts in `public_html/js/`) for any string-based dynamic imports, `import()`, `require()`, or script injection referencing `'js/modals.js'` or `'js/toast.js'` (without `/ui/`).
  - **Result:** No incorrect references found. All code uses correct paths or does not reference these modules incorrectly.
  - **Rationale:** Prevents UI breakage due to missing or misrouted modal and toast modules. Ensures all UI features relying on modals and toasts are correctly restored and loaded.
- [x] **Atomic Fix:** Searched all Playwright and other test/automation scripts for references to `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js`, correcting them to `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js` if found.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures all test scripts reference the correct, current UI module paths, preventing import errors and maintaining consistency after file relocations.
  - **Result:** No references to `/js/modals.js` or `/js/toast.js` were found in any test or automation scripts. No code changes were necessary.
  - **Date:** 2025-05-06
- [x] **Audit: Service Worker & PWA Manifest references to `/js/modals.js` and `/js/toast.js`**
  - **Action:** Searched the entire codebase for any service worker registration (e.g., `serviceWorker.register`) or PWA manifest (e.g., `manifest.json`) that could be requesting `/js/modals.js` or `/js/toast.js`.
  - **Result:** No service worker registrations or PWA manifests referencing these files were found. All references to `modals.js` and `toast.js` are standard ES module imports in UI-related JavaScript files, not in a manifest or service worker context.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures that deprecated or unnecessary service worker/PWA manifest requests for these files do not exist, preventing potential 404s or caching issues. No changes were required.
- [x] **Audit of all JS imports for `modals.js` and `toast.js` path correctness (2025-05-06):**
    - Searched all JS files in `public_html/js/` and subdirectories for import statements referencing `modals.js` or `toast.js` that do not use the `/ui/` path.
    - No incorrect imports were found; all references (if present) use the correct `/js/ui/modals.js` and `/js/ui/toast.js` paths.
    - No code changes were necessary.
    - **Rationale:** Ensures consistent and correct module resolution, prevents runtime errors due to incorrect import paths, and maintains codebase integrity.
